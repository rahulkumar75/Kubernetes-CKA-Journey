# 🆚 Node Affinity vs Taints & Tolerations

| Feature | Node Affinity | Taints & Tolerations |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Purpose | Attract pods to nodes | Repel unwanted pods |
| Type | Rule-based | Filter-based |
| Strict Control | ✅ Yes | ❌ No |
| Scheduling Guarantee | ✅ Yes (required) | ❌ No |
| Best Use | Node selection | Node protection |

---

# 📦 Use Cases

## 🚀 When to Use Node Affinity

1. **Large Clusters**
    - Control workload placement
2. **GPU / AI / ML Workloads**
    - Run only on GPU nodes
3. **SSD / High-performance nodes**
    - Database workloads
4. **Environment separation**
    - Dev / Prod nodes
5. **Compliance / Security**
    - Sensitive workloads on specific nodes

---

# 🧠 Final Summary (Interview Ready)

👉 Node Affinity is used to **control Pod placement using node labels**

- **Required** → strict (must match)
- **Preferred** → soft (best effort)
- **IgnoredDuringExecution** → no impact after scheduling

👉 Best practice:

> Combine **Node Affinity + Taints & Tolerations** for full control
> 

# 📑 Node Affinity in Kubernetes

## 📌 Problem Statement

Sometimes, we want to control **which node a Pod should run on**.

Basic scheduling may not be enough when:

- You have **specific hardware (GPU, SSD, etc.)**
- You want **strict placement rules**
- You need **better control than Taints & Tolerations alone**

---

## 🔧 What is Node Affinity?

**Node Affinity** is a way to **constrain which nodes your Pod can be scheduled on** based on **node labels**.

👉 It is a **more advanced and flexible version of nodeSelector**

---

## 🧠 Key Idea

> Pod → defines rules
> 
> 
> Node → must satisfy those rules (based on labels)

# ⚠️ Limitation of Taints & Tolerations

- Taints prevent pods from scheduling **unless tolerated**
- But they **don’t guarantee** pod will go to a specific node

👉 Example problem:

- Pod tolerates taint → it can go to multiple nodes
- ❌ No strict control

---

# ✅ Node Affinity Solves This

Node Affinity allows:

- 🎯 **Hard rules (must match)**
- 🎯 **Soft rules (preferred match)**

---

# 🔑 Types of Node Affinity

## 1. Required (Hard Rule)

### `requiredDuringSchedulingIgnoredDuringExecution`

👉 **Strict condition**

- Pod **WILL NOT schedule** if condition not met
- Node **must match label**

✔ Example:

```yaml
requiredDuringSchedulingIgnoredDuringExecution:
  nodeSelectorTerms:
  - matchExpressions:
    - key: disktype
      operator: In
      values:
      - ssd
```

✔ Meaning:

- Pod only runs on nodes with `disktype=ssd`

---

## 2. Preferred (Soft Rule)

### `preferredDuringSchedulingIgnoredDuringExecution`

👉 **Best effort condition**

- Scheduler **tries** to match
- If not possible → still schedules

✔ Example:

```yaml
preferredDuringSchedulingIgnoredDuringExecution:
- weight: 1
  preference:
    matchExpressions:
    - key: disktype
      operator: In
      values:
      - ssd
```

✔ Meaning:

- Prefer SSD nodes
- But fallback allowed

---

# ⚠️ Important Concept

## 🧩 “Ignored During Execution”

👉 This is VERY IMPORTANT for interviews

- Once Pod is scheduled → it **won’t be evicted**
- Even if:
    - Node label changes
    - Label is removed

✔ Impact:

- Existing Pods → ✅ Keep running
- New Pods → ❗ Re-evaluated

---

# 🧪 What if Label is Removed?

## Scenario:

- Node label becomes empty / removed

### Behavior:

| Type | Result |
| --- | --- |
| Required | New pods ❌ won’t schedule |
| Preferred | New pods ✅ may still schedule |
| Existing Pods | ✅ No impact |

---

# 🔍 Operators in Node Affinity

| Operator | Meaning |
| --- | --- |
| In | Value must match |
| NotIn | Value must NOT match |
| Exists | Key must exist |
| DoesNotExist | Key must NOT exist |

✔ Example:

```yaml
operator: Exists
```

👉 Only checks label presence, not value

# ⚡ Node Affinity + Taints & Tolerations

## 📷 Combined Approach

---

## 🔥 Why Combine Both?

| Feature | Role |
| --- | --- |
| Taints & Tolerations | ❌ Restrict unwanted pods |
| Node Affinity | ✅ Force desired placement |

---

## 💡 Real Problem

👉 Using only Taints:

- Pod may still go to **any tolerated node**
- ❌ Not strict

---

## ✅ Solution (Combination)

1. Add **taint** → restrict nodes
2. Add **toleration** → allow pod
3. Add **node affinity** → force correct node

👉 Result:

- 🎯 **Only desired node gets the pod**
